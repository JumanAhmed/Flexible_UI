        <item>In this mode OUT is low. Once a count is loaded the counter is decremented after every cycle,
and when count reaches zero, the OUT goes high. The OUT remains high until a new count  is loaded.
</item>
        <item>In this mode OUT is intially high. When gate is triggered, the OUT goes low, and at the end of
count it goes high again, thus generating a one shot pulse.
</item>
        <item>The mode is used to generate a pulse equal to given clock period at a given interval.
When a count is loaded, the OUT stays high until count reaches 1 and then OUT goes low
for 1 clock period then gets reloaded automatically.
</item>
        <item>In this a continuous square wave with period equal to count is generated.
The frequency of square wave = frequency of clock divide by count.
if count (N) is odd pulse stay high for (N + 1)/2 and low for (N â€“ 1)/2.</item>
